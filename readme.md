# Cat and Dog Image Prediction using Convolutional Neural Networks

## Overview
This project involves building and deploying a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification, specifically to differentiate between images of cats and dogs. The project demonstrates various stages of data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and testing, showcasing deep learning techniques.

## Workflow
- **Data Preprocessing**: Images are resized and normalized to prepare them for training.
- **Model Architecture**: A CNN is implemented to extract features from images and classify them.
- **Model Evaluation**: The model's performance is assessed using metrics like accuracy.
- **Deployment**: The trained model can predict whether a given image is of a cat or a dog.

## Data dependencies
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For building and training the CNN.
- **NumPy & Pandas**: For data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing results.
- **AWS Lambda**: To deploy the model and manage the infrastructure.

### Running the Project
1. Open the Jupyter notebook `cnn.ipynb`.
2. Execute the cells step-by-step to preprocess data, train the model, and make predictions.

## Acknowledgments
This project leverages publicly available datasets and open-source libraries to implement the CNN model. Thanks to the contributors of these resources for their efforts.
